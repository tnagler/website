I am currently Assistant Professor for Statistics at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/applied-mathematics/statistics).
I obtained a PhD in Mathematical Statistics from TU Munich in 2018 and 
was Assistant Professor at Leiden University from 2019 to 2021.

My research interests evolve mostly around high-dimensional dependence models, 
nonparametric methods, and computational statistics. I invent new models and 
 methods, derive theoretical guarantees, develop efficient computational 
algorithms, package them in [user-friendly software](software), and collaborate with domain 
experts to solve problems in diverse scientific areas.
