<!-- I am Professor for Computational Statistics & Data Science at the Department of Statistics, [LMU Munich](https://www.en.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), and affiliated with the [Munich Center for Machine Learning](https://mcml.ai/). -->

I am currently Professor for Computational Statistics & Data Science at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.en.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/). 
Previously, I served as Assistant Professor for Statistics at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/applied-mathematics) (2021-2022) and [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics) (2019-2021), after graduating from my alma mater, [TU Munich](https://www.ma.tum.de/en) in 2018. 

My research is at the intersection of mathematical and computational statistics. I develop statistical methods, derive theoretical guarantees and scalable algorithms, package them in user-friendly software, and collaborate with domain experts to solve problems in diverse areas.

## Research interests 
  - High-dimensional dependence models
  - Nonparametric estimation and statistical learning
  - Time series and functional data
  - Statistical computing and software
