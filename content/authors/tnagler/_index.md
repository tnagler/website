I am Assistant Professor for Statistical Science at the [Mathematical
Institute, Leiden
University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics/statistical-science).
In 2018, I obtained a PhD in Mathematical Statistics from TU Munich under the
supervision of [Claudia
Czado](https://www.groups.ma.tum.de/en/statistics/people/claudia-czado/).

My methodological research evolves around on dependence models and
nonparametric estimation. I also develop open source research software and
collaborate with other scientists on statistical applications.
