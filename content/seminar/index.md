*How to gamble if you must: the d’Alembert system*   

"The d’Alembert" is the name of a gambling system in which a player bets repeatedly at even house odds at a roulette table. According to the system, the player should increase her stake by one unit every time she loses and decrease it by one unit (as long as it does not thereby become zero) every time she wins. Her initial stake is one unit. The player must furthermore stop playing after a pre-chosen maximum number of rounds, or earlier if her capital falls below a pre-chosen threshhold. Harry Crane and Glenn Shafer (2020), in a preprint on [Researchers.one](https://researchers.one/) entitled “Risk is random: the magic of the d’Alembert”, conclude "By modestly increasing your bet after losses and modestly decreasing it after wins, you can assure a very high return with very high probability. Similar but more aggressive strategies can achieve even better results when you have more capital to risk."

I will present a case-study connected to a criminal trial in which the prosecution brought a charge of money-laundering. I will discuss some of the theory, mention open problems, and present results of simulations and computations using “R”.
