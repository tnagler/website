## Schedule

*Two small-data n << p case studies: Hydroxychloroquine cocktail for early COVID-19 infection; Marseilles and Meijel*

A March 2020 preprint by the famous Marseilles group of Didier Raoult caused international interest and controversy. It promoted a treatment for early Covid-19 infection centred on the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The study was an observational study with a treatment group and a control group of altogether 42 patients, and has a number of very unsatisfactory features. An early HCQ adopter was the Dutch family doctor and alternative medicine practitioner Rob Elens, whose practice is in a village right in the middle of the initial Dutch Corona hotspot. He collected a very similar dataset, and in his case the treatment was almost randomised: at a certain point the Netherlands health inspectorate forbade the use of HCQ, so the treatment given to his patients was entirely determined by outside events: first the publication of Gautret et al., and then the Dutch government ukase. In my talk I will present some analyses by logistic regression, both frequentist and Bayesian, including a solution to the n << p problem, of the two data sets. How strong was this evidence in support of HCQ?

This is work in progress, with several collaborators. I hope to have a paper written soon, and also have permission to publish the data sets.

I will also discuss our current state of knowledge concerning this treatment, in particular thanks to a just published study by Dutch researchers (team leaders based at Isala hospital, Zwolle) <https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)32175-5/pdf>. A problematic issue is that the disease is very much a moving target: the population of patients now, standard treatments now, and the presently dominant strain of the virus, are all rapidly changing.
