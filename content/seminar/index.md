*Multiple imputation for survival analysis with missing data and a cure fraction*   


Nowadays many cancer patients get cured after treatment. Hence, distinguishing between
prognostic factors with curing or life-prolonging effect is of great interest in clinical research.
However, some of these covariates are often not fully observed. In childhood osteosarcoma,
histologic response to pre-operative treatment is known to have a strong effect on survival
while the benefits of intensified chemotherapy remain unclear. Previous osteosarcoma
studies have excluded from the analysis patients with missing histologic response. This
approach might affect the estimated effect of this prognostic factor on survival outcomes.
Assuming that patients are either cured or uncured in the beginning of the study, we
consider cure models as a mixture of two components: the probability of being cured,
modelled through a logistic model, and failure times, modelled using Cox model.
We present multiple imputation as a method of treating missing data using the conditional
distribution of each incomplete covariate. We discuss how it can be used to incorporate
observations with missing covariates into the analysis of survival data with cured subjects.
