- The Statistics group of the Mathematical Institute meets weekly on **Mondays,
13.00-13.45**. 
- Due to the Corona virus, the seminar is held online for an
indefinite time.


## Schedule

*Statistical challenges in modern day astronomy*

Abstract: Due to the increasing amount of data astronomers are gathering, astronomy faces interesting statistical problems in processing their observations. Independent measurements of the same parameter, such as the Hubble constant, yield non-compatible confidence intervals, and forecasts indicate that the problem is only getting worse. One possible cause of these seemingly contradicting conclusions is a non-rigorous approach to the statistical analysis of the data. We discuss the problems studied by the astronomers, and the potentially faulty assumptions used in their statistical models and the resulting effects on confidence sets. A Bayesian framework for misspecified statistical models is discussed, and a Bernstein-Von Mises theorem is derived for the corresponding posterior distributions, which is compared to previous results.
