## Schedule


**08-03-2021** |  Thijs Bos

*Multi-classification and deep neural networks*  

Statistical theory for deep neural networks mainly focuses on regression. In practice neural networks are often used for classification tasks. We will discuss multi-classification and the cross-entropy loss induced by this model . This loss is commonly used in the training of neural networks for classification. We will provide convergence rates with respect to this loss for estimators based on deep neural networks.
