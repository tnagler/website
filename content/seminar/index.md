*E is the New P: Tests that are safe under optional stopping, with an application to time-to-event data*

Abstract: The E-value is a notion of evidence which, unlike p-values, allows for effortlessly combining evidence from several tests, even in the common scenario where the decision to perform a new test depends on previous test outcomes. 'Safe' tests based on E-values generally preserve Type-I error guarantees under such \`optional continuation', thereby potentially alleviating one of the main causes for the reproducibility crisis. Last week, Rianne de Heide showed a general theorem showing that E-values can be constructed for general testing problems with composite nulls/alternatives. After a brief introduction I will continue where Rianne left off a week ago by giving several examples. The main example will be for  time-to-event data. We show how to define an E-value based on Cox' partial likelihood, illustrating with (hypothetical!) data on covid vaccine RCTs. If all research groups were to report their results in terms of E-values rather than p-values, then in principle, one could even do meta-analysis that retains an overall Type-I error guarantee - thus saving greatly on 'research waste'.
