- The Statistics group of the Mathematical Institute meets weekly on **Mondays,
13.00-13.45**. 
- Due to the Corona virus, the seminar is held online for an
indefinite time.


## Schedule

*Bayesian best-arm identification*

In multi-armed bandits, a learner repeatedly chooses an arm to play, and
receives a reward from the associated unknown probability distribution. We study
the task of best-arm identification (BAI), where the learner is not only asked
to sample an arm at each stage, but is also asked to output a recommendation
(i.e., a guess for the arm with the largest mean reward) after a certain period.
Unlike in another well-studied bandit setting, the learner is not interested in
maximising the sum of rewards gathered during the exploration (or minimising
regret), but only cares about the quality of her recommendation. We investigate
a Bayesian-flavoured sampling rule called Top-Two Thompson sampling (TTTS). In
particular, we justify its use for fixed-confidence BAI. We further propose a
variant of TTTS called Top-Two Transportation Cost (T3C), which disposes of the
computational burden of TTTS. As our main contribution, we provide the first
sample complexity analysis of TTTS and T3C when coupled with a very natural
Bayesian stopping rule, for bandits with Gaussian rewards, solving one of the
open questions raised by Russo (2016). We also provide new posterior convergence
results for TTTS under two models that are commonly used in practice: bandits
with Gaussian and Bernoulli rewards and conjugate priors.
