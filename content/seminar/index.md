- The Statistics group of the Mathematical Institute meets weekly on **Mondays,
13.00-13.45**. 
- Due to the Corona virus, the seminar is held online for an
indefinite time.


## Schedule

**11-05-2020** | Lasse Vuursteen	  

*Distributed nonparametric hypothesis testing with (very) limited communication*

We consider distributed nonparametric hypothesis testing, in which data is distributed over multiple \`\`machines'' (locations / servers / cores). The machines can each communicate a limited amount of bits about their data to a central machine, after which the central machine needs to decide on a hypothesis. We focus on the canonical statistical model of nonparametric signal + white noise, testing a simple null hypothesis (no signal) against the composite alternative (there is a signal). We investigate and reveal some of the possibilities and limitations of detecting a signal with as little as 1 bit of communication by each of the machines. Taking a minimax paradigm, we derive testing lower bounds and describe protocols attaining these lower bounds. 

This is a joint work with Botond Szabó and Harry van Zanten.
