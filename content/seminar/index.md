*Bayesian Sensitivity Analysis for Causal Inference*  

When conducting causal inference, some assumptions are required to hold to perform valid data analysis. Some of these assumptions are difficult to test, while having a big impact on the results. This is why it is important to test the effect of varying these assumptions. This process is called sensitivity analysis. One method of obtaining a single outcome, without too many assumptions, is by using Bayesian methods and incorporating prior beliefs. We will discuss a semi-parametric model introduced by Scharfstein et. al. (2003) and will show two different parametrisations. In practice, one might have “better” prior beliefs for a certain parametrisation, so it is necessary to have guarantees in both frameworks. We will show three different semi-parametric Bernstein-von Mises theorems, which use either Dirichlet process priors or arbitrary priors with some extra assumptions.
