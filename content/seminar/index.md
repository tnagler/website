## Schedule



**15-03-2020** | *canceled*

**29-03-2021** |  Solomiia Kurchaba
 
*Automatic ship plume detection with S5P â€“ TROPOMI satellite data*

Starting from January 2020, new International Maritime Organisation (IMO) regulations limiting the Sulphur content of the fuel used by seagoing vessels came into force. As of 2021, new and stricter NOx emission standards are applied for ships entering the North and Baltic Sea. There are various methods that are used to measure the pollution produced by ships in ports or off the coastal areas. Due to practical limitations, however, the conduction of such monitoring above the open sea has not been possible up to now.

With S5P-TROPOMI satellite data, plumes produced by individual ships of substantial size can be visually detected. In this talk I will introduce AVES-oculuS project which aims at estimation of NO2/SO2 produced by seagoing vessels. I will show how measures of spatial autocorrelation can be used for an enhancement of satellite signal. I will further explain a heuristic algorithm that uses local weather conditions (wind speed/direction) for an efficient ship-plume matching and consequent estimation of NO2 concentration.
