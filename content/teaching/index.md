## Thesis supervision

My group is supervising theses at both BSc and MSc levels, on a wide range of topics. Our group's primary interest is in developing and understanding statistical methods and models. Here's a non-exhaustive list of areas of particular interest:

* Copulas and other dependence models
* Functional data analysis
* Time series
* Probabilistic machine learning
* Statistical learning theory
* Bootstrap, cross-validation, and other resampling methods

Of course, theses about these topics may involve applications to real problems in environmental sciences, engineering, finance, insurance, etc.

Interested LMU students may send an email with a recent transcript and indication of their interests.
